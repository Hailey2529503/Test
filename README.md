# What is markdown?

This is a demo to show the markdown formats.    
Let's try a few different things.

## Number 1 Bold

This is a **BOLD** text.

## Number 2 Italic

This is a *ITALIC* word.

## Number 3 blockquote

This is to show how a blockquote looks like:
> Hi I am a block.  
> Hi I am still in block.
>
>> Hi I am in a blok in block.

## Number 4 Heading
This is a new heading and I am added in local main.
I am added online.
